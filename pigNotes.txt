What is Pig ? 
Pig provides an engine for executing data flows in parallel on Hadoop.
It includes a language, Pig Latin, for expressing these data flows.

Pig runs on Hadoop. 
It makes use of both the Hadoop Distributed File System, HDFS, and Hadoopâ€™s processing system, MapReduce.

Word Count in pig :
lines = load '/home/devo/c4493001/sales_aggr/processes.txt' as (line);
words = foreach lines GENERATE FLATTEN(TOKENIZE (line)) as word ;
grouped = GROUP words by word ;
wordcount = foreach grouped generate group,COUNT(words) ; 
DUMP wordcount ; 

line : 1017 table_name Mon Apr  3 07:07:24 GMT 2017 
TOKENIZE operator : first splits each line into words . It creates a bag of words 
e.g ({(1017),(table_name),(Mon),(Apr),(3),(07:07:24),(GMT),(2017)})

FLATTEN function : the bag is converted into a tuple
e.g (1017)
(table_name)
(Mon)
(Apr) and so on .... 

then the  words are grouped together so that the count can be computed 
e.g DUMP grouped gives : (Apr,{(Apr),(Apr),(Apr),(Apr),(Apr),(Apr),(Apr),(Apr),(Apr),(Apr),(Apr),(Apr),(Apr),(Apr),(Apr)}) 
final result : (Apr,15) 


Id, product_name
-----------------------
10, iphone
20, samsung
30, Nokia


Field: A field is a piece of data. In the above data set product_name is a field. 
Tuple: A tuple is a set of fields. Here Id and product_name form a tuple. Tuples are represented by braces. Example: (10, iphone). 
Bag: A bag is collection of tuples. Bag is represented by flower braces. Example: {(10,iphone),(20, samsung),(30,Nokia)}. 
Relation: Relation represents the complete database. A relation is a bag. To be precise relation is an outer bag. We can call a relation as a bag of tuples.
